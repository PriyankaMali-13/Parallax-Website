<h2>About Sadguru Shree Aniruddha Bapu</h2>
<p>I am one among you. A simple common being', says Sadguru Shree Aniruddha Bapu but that in fact is His uniqueness. 
A family person Himself, He connects with us common persons as a 'friend' - a friend who loves unconditional, a friend who wants to see us happy. 
And yet for millions this 'friend' for life is a father, a mother - in fact all of these always - He is their Sadguru. He is their guide, who walks the path to show the way.
Spirituality consists in never losing sight of the fact that every deed, word and thought is open to God and He is aware of these the very moment they occur and
walking this path leads to contentment. So neither is spirituality far removed from worldly life nor need one turn away from the family and worldly affairs to attain the 
Highest purpose in life', says He, the Sadguru who speaks clear, precise, lucid and simple.To know more about SHREE ANIRUDDHA BAPU visit the link ahead<a href="https://aniruddhabapu.in/"> AniruddhaBapu</a></p>

Charkha Project

<h2>Aniruddha Bapu Charkha Project</h2>
<p>The first and the foremost point of which was the Charkha Yojna (the spinning wheel project). If we take a look at our past, the Charkha had created history during India’s freedom struggle. 
The threads of its yarn had united the entire nation and tied the communities closely. Moreover, Mahatma Gandhi had used the Charkha as a weapon against the British.
 He rebuffed the clothes imported from Britain, by harboring the weapon used for weaving the ‘Swadeshi‘ (Indigenously created) cloth. It was an extensive conflict against foreign goods because long before
 the British invasion, the clothes would be manufactured from the cotton produced in the Indian homeland. Its yarn would be spun in the households on the charkha. However, the British destroyed the in-house clothing 
trade and began buying cotton from India as a raw material, manufactured clothes and then had the clothes imported back into India. Mahatma Gandhi evoked a sense of self-respect in every Indian by bearing the charkha 
as a weapon against the British to create Swadeshi goods for use in daily life.
